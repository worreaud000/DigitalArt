### Victor Vasarely
Victor Vasarely is an artist internationally recognized as the leader of the op art movement. His art had a lot of illusions, and was very geometric.
He was born in 1906, and studied art all through school and college. He got a lot of his inspiration from Gordes, and bought a house there in 1948 with his wife Claire. He stayed in that house with her every summer from 1950 to 1990. In the late 1960s, he refurbished the gordes chateau to be a musem holding all of his art, which stayed there up until 1996, a year before his death.
