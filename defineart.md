# How Would You Define Art?

Art is a way to express things. It can be a picture, a song, a drawing, a sculpture, a video, a piece of literature, or even something like a dance. You could call almost anything art, because what counts as being art isn't a set thing. Of course, I said almost anything, some things just can't be art. Most of them can be art when coupled with something else, but alone they cannot. Screwing in a lightbulb because the old one burnt out isn't art, but if you were to use it in the right way, it could be.

Art is a very dynamic thing, what's considered art changes and moves with time, trends, technology, and humanity. Someone from before video existed wouldn't consider it a work of art, because the concept of art has changed since their time.
