### About Op Art
  Op art is pretty much what would happen if pop art and optical illusions had a kid. It's got the color and contrast from the pop art, the patterns and illusions from the optical illusions, and then a little bit of it's own thing added in. There's a lot of conflict between the patterns, it's typically either extremely vibrant or black and white, but always with very high contrast. 
  I think that it's really cool. The elements of the two combined makes for some really amazing works. The conflicting, overlapping, contrasting patterns and colors make for a lot on the eyes, but at the same time it can also be extremely simple. Op art is less of spectrum and more of just the endpoints of multiple spectrums. Vibrant or black and white, complex or rudimentary.
