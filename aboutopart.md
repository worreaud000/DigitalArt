## About Op Art
Op art is pretty much what would happen if pop art and optical illusions had a kid. It's got the color and contrast from the pop art, the patterns and illusions from the optical illusions, and then a little bit of it's own thing added in. There's a lot of conflict between the patterns, it's typically either extremely vibrant or black and white, but always with very high contrast. I think that it's really cool. The elements of the two combined makes for some really amazing works. The conflicting, overlapping, contrasting patterns and colors make for a lot on the eyes, but at the same time it can also be extremely simple. Op Art is less of spectrum and more of just the endpoints of multiple spectrums. Vibrant or black and white, complex or rudimentary.
 

### A Few Sources

[The Art Story](https://www.theartstory.org/movement-op-art.htm) provides a summary of the history, important details and artists, and concepts of Op Art, while also keeping it relatively concise and understandable. It filters out the unimportant, minute details and focuses on the big picture without diluting the concept.

[Tate](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/o/op-art) doesn't focus much on the actual history, meaning, or concepts of Op Art. It focuses on the artists and works. The amount of information on Op Art as a whole is extremely minimal, but that's made up for by the amount of information on individual artists that's catalogued alongside it.

[National Galleries Scotland](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/glossary-terms/op-art) is similar to The Art Story in that it focuses on the history and details of Op Art, but it's also got some similarity to Tate, as it does talk about the important artists a bit as well. This one also talks about Op Art's connection with Kinetic Art, and the origin of the term Op Art. It's more consice than The Art Story, but lengthier than Tate.

[Art History](http://www.arthistory.net/op-art/) combines elements of all of the others. It focuses more on the artists than National Galleries Scotland and The Art Story, but it's not entirely focused on them like Tate. It's pretty concise and brings up several new names to the list of artists, while also explaining the connections Op Art has with other art movements in another new light.


### A Few Artists

##### Philip Taafe
Philip was born in 1955 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He has quite a few Op Art pieces. Eros and Psyche¹ and Pine Columns² are examples of this. Both use bright and contrasting colors, patterns, and warm colors. I think his work is nice, if but not my favorite, and I can't exactly explain why. 


Eros and Psyche¹                                                  Pine Columns²
